I am a PhD student at the [EPSRC & MRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Next Generational Statistical Science](http://www.oxwasp-cdt.ac.uk/epsrc--mrc-centre-for-doctoral-training.html) based at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) and the [Big Data Institute](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/).

I am supervised by [David Wedge](/author/david-wedge), [Jens Rittscher](http://www.ibme.ox.ac.uk/research/biomedia/jens-rittscher), [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes) and [Heba Sailem](http://www.ibme.ox.ac.uk/research/biomedia/people/dr-heba-sailem) and work on the integration of Genomics and Image Analysis for the study of cancer subtypes to predict tumour behaviour and response to treatment using Statistical Machine Learning.

Prior to Oxford, I completed a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), where I carried out a research project in Survival Analysis investigating End Stage Renal Disease in children across Scotland using Electronic Health Records data. For my dissertation, I explored Epidemic Modelling on Complex Networks through agent based simulations.
