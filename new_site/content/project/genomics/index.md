title: Subclonal analysis and inferral of evolutionary timelines in colorectal tumours
date: "2022-01-31"
summary: "We identify mutations and copy number events on a set of colorectal samples to infer the chronological evolution of the tumours. We employ Dirichlet process clustering to assign mutations to clones and Plackett-Luce models to order genes chronologically."
