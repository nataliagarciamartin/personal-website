The precise and robust measurement of a broad range of biomolecules in the tissue
architecture context opens up new opportunities for improving our understanding of disease,
monitoring therapeutic response, and the development of high-dimensional clinical tests. In
this study we apply multiplex IF staining platform (Perkin-Elmer Vectra) on a diverse set of
cancer cases. These include samples of different tissue types from Genomics England and a
set of colorectal polyps from the S:CORT (Stratification in Colorectal Cancer) cohort.
